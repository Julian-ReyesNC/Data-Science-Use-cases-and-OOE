# Data-Science-Use-cases-and-OOE
The python notebook indicates that the project is a sisplaying usage of DS. All OOE projects I coded in C++ to distinguish the two.

For data science projects:

  1. Open the notebook via Jupyter Lab (https://jupyter.org/) or your preferred IDE.
  2. Read the markdown cells
  3. Run code cells with [Shift]+[Enter]
       -The output will be displayed below the cell
       -The purpose of the notebook is to display the project in a simple step-by-step manner that is digestible for everyone

For C++ projects:

This is more tricky...
  1. To run the project you will need to assure that the main file, the .h file, and the .cpp file are all in same directory.
     (Some IDE's may require you to link the files)
  2. Once that is done run the main file (The .h file and .cpp file are not to be ran by the user).
  3. Wah Lah! OOE programming!
